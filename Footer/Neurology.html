      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Neurology is a medical specialty that focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of conditions affecting the nervous system. The nervous system is a complex network that includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, and it controls and coordinates various bodily functions.</p>
      <p>Neurologists are specialized physicians who have extensive knowledge and training in the field of neurology. They assess and treat a wide range of neurological disorders, including conditions related to the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and muscles.</p>
      <p>Neurological conditions can vary greatly in their nature and severity, ranging from chronic conditions like epilepsy and multiple sclerosis to acute conditions like stroke and traumatic brain injury. The field of neurology is constantly advancing, with ongoing research and new treatments being developed to improve patient outcomes.</p>

      <h2>Common Conditions</h2>
      <p>Neurologists diagnose and treat a wide range of neurological conditions. Some of the most common conditions seen in neurology include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Epilepsy: A neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures.</li>
        <li>Migraine: Severe headaches often accompanied by other symptoms like nausea, sensitivity to light, and sound.</li>
        <li>Stroke: A sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain, leading to brain damage and neurological deficits.</li>
        <li>Multiple Sclerosis (MS): A chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, leading to inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath.</li>
        <li>Parkinson's Disease: A progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, causing tremors, stiffness, and balance problems.</li>
        <li>Alzheimer's Disease: A degenerative brain disorder characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes.</li>
        <li>Peripheral Neuropathy: Damage to the peripheral nerves, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and weakness in the limbs.</li>
        <li>ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis): A progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and eventual paralysis.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="treatments">
      <h2>Treatments</h2>
      <p>The treatment of neurological conditions depends on the specific condition and its underlying causes. Neurologists employ various treatment approaches to manage and improve the symptoms and quality of life for their patients. Some common treatment options in neurology include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Medications: Neurologists may prescribe medications to control symptoms, manage pain, prevent disease progression, or address underlying conditions.</li>
        <li>Physical Therapy: Physical therapy can help improve mobility, strength, and coordination in individuals with neurological conditions.</li>
        <li>Speech Therapy: Speech therapy may be recommended to improve communication and swallowing difficulties in patients with neurological disorders.</li>
        <li>Occupational Therapy: Occupational therapy focuses on helping patients regain and maintain independence in daily activities.</li>
        <li>Surgical Interventions: In some cases, neurosurgical procedures may be necessary to treat specific neurological conditions or alleviate symptoms.</li>
        <li>Lifestyle Modifications: Lifestyle changes, such as diet modifications, exercise, stress management, and sleep hygiene, can play a role in managing certain neurological conditions.</li>
        </ul>
