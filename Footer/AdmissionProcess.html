      <h2>1. Registration:</h2>
      <p>The first step is to visit the hospital's registration desk or admission counter. Here, you will need to provide your personal details and complete the necessary forms. You may be asked to present identification documents such as an ID card, passport, or Aadhaar card.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="box">
      <h2>2. Medical Evaluation:</h2>
      <p>Once you have completed the registration process, a medical professional will assess your condition. This could involve a physical examination, review of medical history, and diagnostic tests such as blood tests, X-rays, or scans.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="box">
      <h2>3. Consultation:</h2>
      <p>After the initial evaluation, you will be referred to a specialist or a consultant doctor who will review your case and provide further guidance on the course of treatment. They may prescribe medication, suggest further tests, or recommend hospitalization if required.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="box">
      <h2>4. Admission:</h2>
      <p>If hospitalization is deemed necessary, the doctor will issue an admission order. You will receive an admission slip or card specifying the ward and bed allotted to you. At this stage, you may need to make the necessary financial arrangements, such as paying a deposit or providing health insurance details.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="box">
      <h2>5. Accommodation:</h2>
      <p>Once admitted, you will be escorted to the assigned ward or room. The hospital staff will provide you with a hospital gown or patient dress to wear during your stay.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="box">
      <h2>6. Treatment and Care:</h2>
      <p>During your hospitalization, the medical team will administer the prescribed treatment and monitor your progress. Nurses and support staff will assist you with daily activities, administer medication, and provide necessary care.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="box">
      <h2>7. Discharge Process:</h2>
      <p>When you have recovered or the treatment is complete, the doctor will issue a discharge summary. This document outlines the diagnosis, treatment received, medication instructions, and any follow-up recommendations. You will settle the final bill, and the hospital will provide you with the necessary paperwork for insurance claims if applicable.</p>
