      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Urology is a medical specialty that focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of conditions related to the urinary tract system and male reproductive organs. Urologists are medical professionals with specialized knowledge and expertise in addressing urological issues in both males and females.</p>
      <p>The urinary tract system consists of the kidneys, bladder, ureters, and urethra, responsible for the production, storage, and elimination of urine. The male reproductive system includes organs such as the testes, prostate, and penis. Urologists are trained to diagnose and manage a wide range of urological conditions, including urinary tract infections, kidney stones, prostate diseases, bladder issues, and urinary incontinence.</p>
      <p>Urology incorporates both medical and surgical approaches to address urological conditions. Urologists employ various diagnostic tools, such as imaging tests, laboratory analyses, and specialized procedures, to accurately assess and treat urological disorders.</p>

      <h2>Common Conditions</h2>
      <p>Urologists diagnose and treat various urological conditions. Some of the most common conditions seen in urology include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs): Infections that affect any part of the urinary system, such as the bladder, urethra, or kidneys.</li>
        <li>Kidney Stones: Hard deposits that form in the kidneys and can cause severe pain when passing through the urinary tract.</li>
        <li>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH): Non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, leading to urinary symptoms such as frequent urination and weak urine flow.</li>
        <li>Prostate Cancer: A malignant tumor that develops in the prostate gland, commonly affecting older men.</li>
        <li>Bladder Issues: Conditions such as bladder infections, overactive bladder, urinary incontinence (leakage of urine), or bladder cancer.</li>
        <li>Erectile Dysfunction: The inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse.</li>
        <li>Kidney Diseases: Various conditions affecting the kidneys, including chronic kidney disease, kidney infections, or kidney tumors.</li>
        <li>Male Infertility: Conditions that affect male reproductive health, including low sperm count, structural abnormalities, or hormonal imbalances.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="treatments">
      <h2>Treatments</h2>
      <p>The treatment options in urology depend on the specific condition,its severity, and the patient's overall health. Urologists may recommend various interventions to manage urological disorders, including:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Medications: Prescribing medications to treat infections, manage symptoms, or address hormonal imbalances.</li>
      <li>Minimally Invasive Procedures: Performing procedures such as cystoscopy, ureteroscopy, or laser lithotripsy to diagnose and treat urological conditions with minimal incisions.</li>
      <li>Surgery: Conducting surgical procedures to remove tumors, treat obstructions, repair structural abnormalities, or perform organ transplants.</li>
      <li>Lithotripsy: Using shock waves to break down kidney stones into smaller fragments that can be naturally passed through the urinary system.</li>
      <li>Hormone Therapy: Administering hormonal treatments to manage conditions such as prostate cancer or male infertility.</li>
      <li>Urinary Incontinence Treatments: Implementing therapies such as pelvic floor muscle exercises, bladder training, or surgical interventions to manage urinary incontinence.</li>
      <li>Prostate Interventions: Performing procedures like transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or prostatectomy to address benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer.</li>
      </ul>
