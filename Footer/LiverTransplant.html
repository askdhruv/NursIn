      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>A liver transplant is a surgical procedure that involves replacing a diseased or damaged liver with a healthy liver from a deceased or living donor. It is performed to treat end-stage liver disease, liver failure, or certain liver cancers that cannot be effectively treated through other means.</p>
      <p>Liver transplantation is a complex procedure that requires a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including hepatologists, transplant surgeons, anesthesiologists, and transplant coordinators. The process involves careful evaluation, organ matching, and post-transplant care to ensure the best outcomes for patients.</p>
      <p>After a successful liver transplant, the new liver can restore normal liver function and improve the patient's quality of life. However, lifelong medical management, including immunosuppressive medications, is necessary to prevent organ rejection and ensure long-term success.</p>

    <section id="candidates">
      <h2>Candidates for Liver Transplant</h2>
      <p>Liver transplantation is considered for individuals who have severe liver disease or liver failure that cannot be effectively managed with other treatments. Common indications for liver transplant include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cirrhosis</li>
        <li>Hepatitis B or C infection</li>
        <li>Alcoholic liver disease</li>
        <li>Primary biliary cholangitis</li>
        <li>Primary sclerosing cholangitis</li>
        <li>Autoimmune hepatitis</li>
        <li>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)</li>
        <li>Genetic liver diseases</li>
        <li>Acute liver failure</li>
        <li>Liver cancers</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="procedure">
      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <p>The liver transplant procedure involves several stages:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Evaluation: Candidates undergo a comprehensive evaluation to assess their overall health, liver condition, and eligibility for transplantation. This includes medical tests, imaging studies, and psychosocial assessments.</li>
        <li>Waitlisting: If deemed eligible, candidates are placed on a national waiting list for a suitable liver. The allocation is based on factors such as the severity of the liver disease, blood type, body size, and organ availability.</li>
        <li>Surgery: Once a suitable liver becomes available, the transplant surgery is performed. It involves removing the diseased liver and replacing it with the donor liver. The surgery can take several hours.</li>
        <li>Recovery: After surgery, patients are closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for several days to ensure the new liver is functioning properly and there are no complications. They are then transferred to a regular hospital room for further recovery and monitoring.</li>
        <li>Follow-up: After discharge, patients continue to have regular follow-up visits with their healthcare team to monitor their progress and manage any complications or issues that may arise. Lifelong immunosuppressive medications are necessary to prevent organ rejection and ensure long-term success.</li>
      </ol>

    <section id="recovery">
      <h2>Recovery and Follow-up</h2>
      <p>The recovery and follow-up period after liver transplant can vary depending on individual factors, such as age, overall health, and the presence of any complications. However, most patients can expect the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hospital stay: Most patients stay in the hospital for several days to a week after the transplant surgery. During this time, they are monitored closely to ensure the new liver is functioning properly and there are no complications.</li>
        <li>Medications: Patients must take immunosuppressive medications for the rest of their lives to prevent organ rejection. They also may need to take other medications to manage other health conditions or complications.</li>
        <li>Recovery at home: Once discharged, patients will continue to have regular follow-up visits with their healthcare team to monitor their progress and manage any complications or issues that may arise. They also may need to make lifestyle changes, such as following a special diet or avoiding certain activities, to protect their new liver.</li>
        <li>Long-term outlook: With proper medical management, most patients can expect to have good long-term outcomes after liver transplant. However, the risk of complications and organ rejection is always present, and close monitoring and management are necessary to ensure ongoing success.</li>
      </ul>
