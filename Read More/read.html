                <h2 class="section-heading">Streamlining Appointment Booking</h2>
                <p class="section-content">Scheduling a consultation with a doctor often required patients to wait in line, leading to long waiting times and inconvenience. In the traditional manual system, patients had to physically visit the healthcare facility, wait for their turn, and then speak with the doctor about their health issues. This process was time-consuming and could be frustrating for patients.</p>
                <p class="section-content">Obtaining health reports involved additional steps and waiting. Patients had to either visit the healthcare facility on a different day or wait for a specific period of time to receive their reports. This created a burden on care staff as they had to manage the scheduling and retrieval of reports, which consumed resources and time.</p>
                <p class="section-content">The manual system posed challenges for patients who did not have immediate access to cash. In some cases, patients might need to pay for their treatment upfront or provide cash for various healthcare services. If they didn't have cash readily available, it could create difficulties for them in receiving timely treatment.</p>
